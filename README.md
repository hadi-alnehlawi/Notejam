# Introduction #
Notejam applicaiton was first created as monolith and this project goal is to re-design it as microservice running on cloud. It would be more scalable and high available with out-of-the-box networking and security integrations.
# Architecture #
The new application would be containerized to run on AWS and use its kubernetes cluster technology *EKS*, as it is the most trusted way to start, run and scal Kubernetes. At the end we are going to create an application that automatically scale up/down and run in a high availability configuraiotn . The diagram shows the new architecture

The project consists of several steps:
1. Desgining
2. Preparing
3. Deployment
4. Setup CI/CD
