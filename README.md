# Introduction #
In order to deploy the application on the cloud, we need first to set a new architecture which is going to be running on AWS.
# Architecture #
The new architecture is built as microservice, and containerize the application to be run on the AWS and using the technology of AWS kubernetes cluster *EKS*, as it is the most trusted way to start, run and scal Kubernetes. At the end we are going to create an application that automatically scale up/down and run in a high availability configuraiotn with out-of-the-box networking and security integrations. The diagram shows the new architecture

The project consists of several steps:
1. Desgining
2. Preparing
3. Deployment
4. Setup CI/CD
